# Mpesa SDK for PHP
A **Clean, Elegant, and Independent** PHP SDK for interacting with Safaricom Daraja APIs. The SDK is purely object-oriented and easy to understand and use. It has no dependency and hence can be used in any PHP project: plain or framework-based.
# Requirement
- PHP version >= 7.4
## Get it with Composer
```composer require levizwannah/mpesa-sdk-php```

And then start using it.

## not using composer
Download the zip version of the code. Write your own autoloader for the `LeviZwannah\MpesaSdk` namespace or include the file manually. It's better to just include all the files at once because the main class `LeviZwannah\MpesaSdk\Mpesa` uses all the other classes.
